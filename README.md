Corner Grocer Inventory Tracker – CS210 Project 3


This repository contains a C++ console application created for Southern New Hampshire University’s CS-210: Programming Languages course. The application functions as an inventory tracker for a fictional grocery store, Corner Grocer. It analyzes daily sales data to determine the frequency at which items are purchased by customers.

The program reads a provided input file (CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt) containing daily sales transactions. It calculates how often each item is sold and presents these findings through a clear and intuitive menu-driven interface. Users can view the frequency of individual items, see a complete list of all items sold with their respective counts, or visualize sales data through a textual histogram represented by asterisks. Additionally, the application generates an output file (frequency.dat) summarizing item frequencies to facilitate future data analysis and reporting.

Key features include efficient file operations for handling input and output, use of associative data structures (such as std::map) to efficiently store item frequencies, and a modular code design that simplifies maintenance and readability. Robust error handling ensures reliable user input and accurate data processing.

To get started, users need a C++ compiler installed, after which they can clone the repository, compile the source files, and execute the application.

Developed by Nii Amatey Tagoe, this project demonstrates fundamental concepts in file handling, data management, and user interaction, providing a solid foundation for practical programming skills. For questions or further details, users are encouraged to reach out to the author directly.
